Changes since release 0.3.3
---------------------------

- Added new structs type 'structs_type_ip6'
- Fixed lots of compiler warnings, mostly related to casting between
  int's and pointers and alignment (these only occurred when building
  on non-i386 platforms).
- Fix some bugs when handling errors from fread() and fwrite()
- Simplify logic in http_server code for limiting the number of
  simultaneous connections
- Fix bug in http_servlet_xmlrpc(3) where if a field in the response
  was equal to its default value it would be omitted. Related to this,
  add a new 'flags' field to 'struct http_servlet_xml_info'.
- Add support to http_servlet_xmlrpc(3) for handling method names which
  are not known ahead of time.
- Change filter(3) read() and write() method to take 'void *' instead
  of 'char *' arguments. Same thing for filter_read(3), filter_write(3),
  and filter_process(3).
- Add support for IFT_L2VLAN type interfaces to ARP code.
- Fixed crashes in structs_xmlrpc2struct() when target type contained
  any pointer type or was a union.
- Added XML <-> XML-RPC conversion to the structs test program.
- Fixed bug in structs_type_dnsname(3) where it would consider the
  empty string invalid even though that was the type's default value.
- Fixed bugs in structs_type_float(3) conversion to and from ASCII.
- Fixed bug in typed_mem(3) where the returned buffer might not be
  properly aligned on some architectures.
- Include the host O/S and architecture in the xmlrpc-test server name.
- Fixed bugs in handling zero return values from SSL_*() routines.
- Fixes, improvements, and tweaks to several man pages.
- Other miscellaneous tweaks.

Changes since release 0.3.2
---------------------------

- Servlets:
  - The basicauth, cookieauth, file, xml, and xmlrpc servlets (the ones
    with callback functions) now all take a void *arg that is passed to the
    callback and a destructor for 'arg' called when the servlet is destroyed
  - Reworked security section of cookieauth man page
  - Fixed bug in file servlet directory redirection where the redirect
    URL was not being URL-encoded
  - Redirect servlet: renamed HTTP_SERVLET_REDIRECT_APPEND_QSTRING to
    HTTP_SERVLET_REDIRECT_APPEND_URL, and added a new type of redirect
    HTTP_SERVLET_REDIRECT_APPEND_QUERY for just appending the query string.
- XML-RPC code:
  - Added support for working with raw, "exploded" XML-RPC types to
    http_xml_send_xmlrpc(), structs_xmlrpc_build_request(), and
    structs_xmlrpc_build_response().
  - Added new function structs_xmlrpc_build_fault_response().
  - Fixed bug in structs_xmlrpc2struct() where error buffer was not
    being filled in sometimes when there was an error.
  - More documentation added to man pages
  - Other minor fixes & tweaks
  - Fixed definition of 'xmlrpc_response' vs. 'xmlrpc_response_union'
  - Test program: three stooges != marx brothers
- Structs:
  - Fix bug in structs_find() finding a union field name with a '.' in it
  - Avoid const field in struct structs_union when compiling with C++
- Fixed GNUmakefile to make 'cc' a variable
- Removed unused files net/Makefile and io/Makefile
- Added net/test subdirectory with test code extracted from source files
- Added top level README file
- Prefix a '1' to the PDEL_VERSION to force it to be a decimal value.

Changes since release 0.3.1
---------------------------

- Added new 'copy' argument to string_buf_input(3)    *** API change ***
- Changes to tmpl(3):
  - Added new function tmpl_create_mmap(3); use it in http_servlet_tmpl(3).
  - Define the function charater '@' as TMPL_FUNCTION_CHARACTER in tmpl.h
  - Optimize execution time by computing the result of applying the
    TMPL_ELEM_NL_WHITE flag at parse time instead of execution time.
  - Corrected the expected output in the tmpl/test directory.
- Fixed bugs in http_response_guess_mime() MIME type guessing algorithm.
- Enhancements & fixes to XML-RPC support:
  - Make public the XML-RPC "exploded" structures and structs types.
  - http_servlet_xmlrpc(3) handler can now work with "exploded" XML-RPC.
  - Added xmlrpc_test program that passes http://validator.xmlrpc.org/
- Enhancements to structs(3):
  - Union and structure fields may now have '.' character in them.
  - Add support to structs_xml_input(3) for combined nested tags when
    the new flag STRUCTS_XML_COMB_TAGS is passed. Add to test program.
  - Add new flag STRUCTS_XML_SCAN to just scan and not decode the XML.
  - In structs_xml_input(3), for union fields, assume the default field
    in case of a missing innermost XML tag.
- Fixed some compiler warnings generated on FreeBSD-current.
- Fixed bug where header files were being installed executable.

  needed for the particular field in use.
- Fixed alog_facility_type to have a valid default value ("daemon")
- Remove "chmod 0666" from rc.sslkey script
- Don't compile -Werror, it breaks on -stable
- Makefile: rename 'INCS' to 'INCHDRS' to avoid conflict on -stable
- Included top level COPYRIGHT file
- Included top level Changes file
