About libpdel on WinCE
----------------------
Libpdel support for WinCE is planned.  The Win32 support has done the bulk 
of the heavy lifting but some work will need to be done.  Currently WinCE is 
not supported and unlikely to compile.  Due to limitations in platforms and
tools it is anticipated that WinCE support will only be for WinCE 5 and 6 
and only for those platforms supported by Visual Studio 2005.
