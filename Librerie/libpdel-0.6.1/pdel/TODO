- Add a 'wrapper' servlet that can match with same pattern/order algorithm
  as the http_server itself.

- Add a 'logger' servlet.

- Fix all man pages to have the proper RETURN VALUES and ERRORS sections.

- Make the structs_find() operations implemented by a type-specific method,
  instead of having special cases for struct, array, and union everywhere.
  Need to defined the new method(s) carefully.
