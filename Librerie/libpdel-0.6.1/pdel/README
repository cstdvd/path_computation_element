This library has been tested on FreeBSD and RedHat Linux.
Other versions of Linux and other operating systems are not
tested but "should work".

There are a few demonstration/test programs in various test
sub-directories scattered about.

Note: this is still considered 'alpha' code until the version number
reaches "1.0.0". Therefore, API's may change between versions. Please
consult the "Changes" for a list of changes.
