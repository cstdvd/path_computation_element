LWS - The Lil' Web Server

About LWS
---------

LWS is a lightweight web server which uses pthreads(3) for multi-tasking
and libpdel(3) for HTTP, HTTPS, and configurable servlet support.  The
server can be configured via a buit-in admin web interface, or by manu-
ally editing the XML configuration file.

LWS supports multiple HTTP and HTTPS servers, each containing multiple
virtual hosts.  Each virtual host has a configurable list of servlets.
The supported servlets types are file, redirect, and cookieauth.  The
file servlet includes optional support for tmpl(3) HTML templates.

LWS maintains a self-rotating logfile(3) error log, with optional support
for logging via syslog as well.

LWS is intended to demonstrate features of the libpdel(3) library, and to
be a lightweight web server for simple applications.

This server has been tested on FreeBSD and RedHat Linux 7.3.
Other versions of Linux and other operating systems are not tested.

Note: this is still considered 'alpha' code until the version number
reaches "1.0.0". Please consult the "Changes" for a list of changes.
